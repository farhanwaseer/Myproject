        moves the mouse, presses a key—and something happens. JavaScript gives you many ways to
        respond to the user's needs. A few examples:
        The user clicks a button saying "Our Guarantee" and an alert displays spelling out the
        guarantee.
        A page displays a "before" picture of a model. When the user mouses over the picture, it
        is replaced by an "after" picture of her.
        The user types a number in the Ounces field on a form. When she clicks in the Grams
        field, the equivalent in grams displays.
        The user has entered her email address in a form, and is about to type a comment. When
        she moves the cursor from the email field to the comment field, JavaScript checks to see if the
        email address is valid. In this case, it isn't—she's omitted ".com" at the end of the address. A
        message displays letting her know that she's entered an invalid email address.
        On an online shopping site, there's a picture of a black watch. Next to it is a drop-down
        list asking the user to choose a color. When she chooses, the color of the watch in the picture
        changes to that color.A good website is a responsive website. The user does something—clicks a button,
